Day 1 of my JavaScript class.

The CSS & HTML don't really have much on them. 

The focus is on the JavaScript.

You can uncomment these parts if you want to see how the examples work:
 1. This is the CODE ALONG javascript page for class. --> learning.js
 2. This is the CODE ALONG MATH javascript page for class. 
 --> math.js 

This is the part that is not commented out:
1. This is the PRACTICE WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED javascript page from class. I came up with this code by myself. It is a lot of fun. --> index.js 

Directions: 

1. Answer all the questions in the prompts. 
2. When you get to the end of the prompts, go to INSPECT and check your CONSOLE LOG for a surprise.
